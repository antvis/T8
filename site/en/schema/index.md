# Schema

## Overview

T8 Schema is a JSON Schema specification for declaratively describing data interpretation reports. It provides a complete type system for building structured narrative text visualization content.

## Core Concepts

T8 Schema system includes the following core concepts:

1. **NarrativeText**

   - Acts as the top-level container for the entire document
   - Contains Headline and multiple Section blocks
   - Supports global style configuration

2. **Section**

   - Used to organize and manage collections of related paragraphs
   - Supports standard paragraph groups and custom blocks
   - Can be flexibly extended to accommodate different display requirements

3. **Paragraph**

   - Supports multiple paragraph types: headings, body text, lists, etc.
   - Each type has its specific structure and purpose
   - Can be extended through custom types

4. **Phrase**
   - Serves as the smallest unit of text composition
   - Includes plain text, entities, and custom phrases
   - Supports rich styling and interaction configuration

## Type System

You can use T8's type definitions in TypeScript projects as follows:

```ts
import type {
  NarrativeTextSpec,
  ParagraphSpec,
  PhraseSpec,
  // ...
} from '@antv/t8';
```

The main type definitions include:

- `NarrativeTextSpec`: Top-level document structure
- `SectionSpec`: Section block structure
- `ParagraphSpec`: Paragraph type definitions
- `PhraseSpec`: Phrase type definitions
- `EntityType`: Entity type enumeration
- `CommonProps`: Common property definitions

## Extensibility

T8 Schema has designed a comprehensive extension mechanism:

1. **Custom Blocks**

   - Extend through the `CustomBlockElement` interface
   - Can implement completely custom block structures

2. **Custom Phrases**

   - Extend through the `CustomPhraseSpec` interface
   - Supports custom metadata and rendering logic

3. **Style System**
   - All components support `CommonProps`
   - Can customize styles through `styles` and `className`
