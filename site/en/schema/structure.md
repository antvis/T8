# Structure Overview

![overview](https://gw.alipayobjects.com/mdn/rms_e59602/afts/img/A*QpAmQYCQL2cAAAAAAAAAAAAAARQnAQ)

A data report includes the following components in its overall structure:

- `Headline`: The title;
- `Section`: Sections used to divide different report topics;

A `Section` contains multiple `Paragraph`s, which can be of the following types:

- `heading1` ~ `heading6` (note that these are different from the report-level Headline, which specifically refers to the article title);
- `normal` for regular text paragraphs, corresponding to the HTML `<p>` tag;
- `bullets` for lists, which can be ordered or unordered, corresponding to HTML `<ul>` and `<ol>` tags, supporting multi-level list nesting;
- `custom` for custom paragraph types;
- `visualization` for visualization charts (not currently supported, can be implemented through custom paragraphs);

Besides the standard type containing multiple `Paragraph`s, `Section` can also be customized.

Except for custom paragraphs, `heading`, `normal`, and `bullets` are all composed of multiple `Phrase`s, which include the following types:

- `text` for plain text;
- `entity` for entities, which correspond to specific data content in the data report;
- `custom` for custom phrases;
