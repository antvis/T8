# T8 Syntax

## Overview

T8 Syntax is a markdown-like language for creating rich narrative text visualizations. It extends standard Markdown with special annotations for data entities, making it easy to highlight metrics, trends, and insights in your text.

## Why T8 Syntax?

T8 Syntax is designed to be:

- **Human-readable**: Based on Markdown, familiar and easy to learn
- **LLM-friendly**: Can be easily generated by AI models with simple prompts
- **Data-aware**: Built-in support for metric values, percentages, trends, and other data entities
- **Extensible**: Support for custom phrases and blocks

## Basic Syntax

T8 Syntax uses standard Markdown for structure and adds special entity annotations using the format:

```
[display text](entity_type, property=value, ...)
```

### Example

```markdown
# Sales Report

Total sales reached [¥1,234,567](metric_value, origin=1234567).

Eastern region contributed [¥800,000](metric_value), 
accounting for [64.8%](contribute_ratio, assessment="positive").
```

## Core Components

T8 Syntax is organized into the following hierarchical structure:

1. **Document**
   - The top-level container for the entire narrative text
   - Can include a headline and multiple sections
   - Supports global styling

2. **Section**
   - Groups related paragraphs together
   - Supports standard paragraphs and custom blocks
   - Can be extended for different display needs

3. **Paragraph**
   - Supports multiple types: headings (# to ######), text, lists
   - Standard Markdown paragraph syntax
   - Can be extended with custom types

4. **Phrase & Entity**
   - The smallest unit of text
   - Plain text or annotated entities
   - Entities include metrics, dimensions, trends, etc.

## Entity Types

T8 provides built-in entity types for common data elements:

- `metric_name` - Name of a metric (e.g., "sales", "revenue")
- `metric_value` - Numeric metric value
- `delta_value` - Change in value (with assessment)
- `ratio_value` - Percentage change
- `contribute_ratio` - Contribution percentage
- `dim_value` - Dimension value (e.g., category, region)
- `trend_desc` - Trend description (e.g., "increasing", "stable")
- `time_desc` - Time period description

See [Phrase & Entity](./types/phrase.md) for complete details.
