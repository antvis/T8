# Quick Start

## What is T8?

> T8 is a text visualization solution in the AntV technology stack, where T stands for Text, and 8 represents a byte (8 bits), symbolizing this tool's ability to deeply analyze insights beneath the text.

Currently, it primarily focuses on a specific domain: **Displaying and editing insight-based narrative text**.

<div class="info-box">

**_"Building text-schema is more costly than directly manipulating DOM, why should I use T8?"_**

To answer this question, we first need to understand where the `JSON` comes from.

The narrative-related technology is based on the assumption that `JSON` data is generated by LLM (Large Language Models), and the frontend simply consumes the schema for rendering. As the requirements for data expression diversity and real-time capabilities increase, and NLP technology becomes more widely applied, maintaining text templates in the frontend will become unsustainable. Using NarrativeTextVis for unified rendering will be the best choice in such cases.

However, it's undeniable that for quite some time, similar text expressions can be satisfied with one or several default templates. Considering the learning curve of `text-schema`, using familiar `dom/jsx` for development might seem like a better choice. <u>_If your business doesn't require high extensibility in text representation and the templates are relatively fixed, please use the syntax you're familiar with._</u> However, using text-schema brings the following benefits:

- As a standard description for interpretative text, it can staticize text data structure, maintain once and reuse everywhere
- The `JSON` format makes it beneficial for data storage and further consumption
- Standardized styling, looks good by default
- Word-scale charts are supported by default, and more inline data visualizations become available with version updates
- Extensibility for related interactions

</div>

## Use Cases

In the full process of data analysis presentation, besides visualization charts, describing data phenomena and providing insights through **text** is equally important.

Especially with the development of augmented analytics, rendering engines are needed to present data text descriptions directly output through NLP (Natural Language Processing) on the user interface. The narrative-text technical solution is designed to address this scenario.

## Features

- Standardized JSON schema for data interpretation text ([narrative-text-schema](../schema/index.md))
- Pure JS rendering engine `Text` for text-schema
  - Parses text structure description JSON schema into HTML
  - Standard visual representation of data phrases (such as metric values, ratios, differences, proportions, contributions, etc.)
  - Data-driven display of inline charts (mini pie, mini line) to improve text reading efficiency

## Basic Usage

T8 can be installed using common package management tools like npm or Yarn.

```bash
$ npm install @antv/t8
```

```bash
$ yarn add @antv/t8
```

After installation, you can import the `Text` object and API from the T8 library.

```html
<div id="container"></div>
```

```js
import { Text } from '@antv/t8';

// Schema to visualize
const schema = {
  /*  */
};

// Instantiate Text
const text = new Text({
  container: 'container',
});

// Specify visualization elements
text.schema(schema).theme('dark');

// Render
const unmount = text.render();

// Destroy
unmount();
```

If you haven't encountered any issues, you should get the following clear data text visualization effect.
